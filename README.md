HW 3 for CPSC 310

Tigger = 0, Pooh = 1

Part 1
1. Pooh's strongest state (according to MrP values): Poplar Point  
   Pooh's weakest state: Oak Haven
   
2. Individual with a very low predicted probability of voting for Pooh:  
   state: Oak Haven, race: tiger, college: 0, predicted probability: 0.2061418  
   Individual with a very high predicted probability of voting for Pooh:  
   state: Woozleburg, race: bear, college: 1, predicted probability: 0.7678621  
   
Part 2
1. Pooh's winning percentage in the first set of simulations = 0.007  
   Pooh's winning percentage in the second set of simulations = 0.125  
   
2. This is a bad idea primarily because each state's probability of being hit by a hurricane is not independent, and this model does not factor that in. Similar to the national-level uncertainty affects state-level uncertainty in the polling simulation, national-level factors such as general weather trends can affect state-level probabilites of being hit by a hurricane. If national-level probability is not factored in, there could be financial consequences. For example, if the overall national probability of hurricanes is higher this year because of weather trends, then the predicted future claims will be much lower than the actual claims, costing the hurricane insurance company a lot of money.
